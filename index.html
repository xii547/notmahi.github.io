<p>Hello, I am Mahi!</p>
<!-- <p><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35402e9112d76326f74f0e141591f4e1?s=512" alt="Me, Mahi"></p> -->
<p>I am a second-year Ph.D. student studying Computer Science at <a href='https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html'>NYU
        Courant </a> working primarily with <a href="lerrelpinto.com">Prof. Lerrel Pinto</a>. I work on machine learning
    problems that allow robots to learn both from humans and on their own. Before this, I was at MIT, working on Robust
    Machine Learning with <a href="madry-lab.ml">Prof. Aleksander Madry</a>, where I got my Masters and Undergraduate
    degrees.</p>

    <p>Right now, my research goal is to figure out how to get robots to cohabitate and collaborate with us in a
        household
        settings. If you are not a robotics person, think of it this way: I plan to retire when I can tell a robot to
        cook
        me <a

        and it can just look up recipes on YouTube and cook it for me.</p>
    <p>Besides my graduate research, I keep busy doing a variety of different things. Just in 2020, I was helping
        Bangladesh
        with <a href="https://notmahi.github.io/bd-rt-dashboard/">COVID-19 data analytics</a> with their <a
            href="https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2020/06/03/ndatf-to-help-bangladesh-government-to-flag-covid-19-risk-zones">National
            Data Analytics Task Force</a>, and helping a university transition to online learning. Since then, I&#39;ve
        also
        helped out a friend&#39;s <a href="https://tryalpine.com">startup</a> with some quantitative analytics. On my
        free
        time, I like reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13481789">books</a>, and visiting the large
        trove of museums in New York.</p>
